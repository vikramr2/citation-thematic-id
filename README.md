# citation-thematic-id
Use an automated prompt engineering approach with a local LLM to get the thematic identity of a citation network cluster

## Objectives

Given a citation network cluster, i.e. nodes (and their doi metadata) and edges (citations):
- Get the thematic identity of the cluster (what does this community study?)
- What is the most defining publication in this network thematically?
