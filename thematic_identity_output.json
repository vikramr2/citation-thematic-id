The study evaluates the performance of different modulation schemes, including Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), electroabsorption modulator (EAM), amplitude modulator (AM), dual drive MZM measured (DDMZMM), electroabsorption modulator measured (EAMM), and LiNb MZM. The network reach is extended to 30 km with 20 Gb/s transmission data rate, and the maximum Q and mini bit error rate are measured at both PIN and APD receivers. The study concludes that the amplitude modulation scheme is the best candidate for upgrading the network performance efficiency.",
